# Contributing Guidelines
## Labels
Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.

- The `help wanted` label is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The `good first` issue label is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.

## Work on the issue assigned
- Keep your commits clean.
- when syncing your fork, consider [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) the changes on top of yours instead of creating a merge commit for the same.
- Make sure to update the documentation accordingly (if required).

## Pull Request

- Go to your fork and create a pull request from there.
- Wait for it to be reviewed and merge by the maintainers/moderators.
- Celebrate :tada:
